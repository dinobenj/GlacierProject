The fllod originated from the upstream of the river which flowed through the dense settlement of the Peshghor village. The landslides and floodwaters hit villages downstream because of the break-up of the natural banks of the dam. As a result, Peshghor and surrounding villages have been cut off and damages have been reported on structures and buildings. Within the current map extent saricha primary road is potentially affected by the landslides and the overflow of Panjshir River. Arount 198 buildings are located within areas affected by the landslide and 9 within areas affected by the floods. It was estimated that 80 houses are potentially destroyed and 20 ha of cultivated land are lost. About 1.5km of the highway was damaged due to flood as well as inundation by formation of lake in the Panjshir River. This disconnected the people living in upstream of river from the main city in downstream. The intake site of irrigation canal and about 400m canal was completely damaged. Another major damage associated with GLOF is erosion and sedimentation along the river. Due to this flood several hundred square meters of fertile agriculture land was covered with debris of sand and boulders. The main sources of the river was glacier and snow melt. The lake was formed on the low land of the moraine deposited by the glacier melt. Lake was first observed on the satellite image of 6 June 2018 which was 0.031 km^2. The area of the lake increased up to the 0.072 km^2 on 1 July 2018. The average rate of increase was 0.002 km^2 per day. After 1 July the lake area started to decrease and just before the flood on 11 July, 2018 the size of the lake was 0.055 km^2. The water flow width in the river increased in the consecutive time of satellite images from 6 July 2018. This indicates that water from the lake was discharging. Melting of ice core inside the moraine dam resulted the lowering of dam, and allowing lake water to pass into the loose unconsolidated moraine and drain over the ice inside the moraine. The continuous water flow into the moraine consisting ice core eroded the debris and melted the ice into the downstream river valley. Eventually, the regressive erosion and melting of debris and ice core into the moraine dam lead to ultimate failure of dam and sudden release of water from the lake causing the devastating flood along the river downstream.

This may indicate that Southeast2 is a surging glacier. (...) Additionally, repeat Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) laser altimetry data from fall 2003 to fall 2009 reveal a thickening of ice in the stagnant regions into which Southeast2 Glacier drains (Boon and others, 2010; Gardner and others, 2011), a characteristic common at the terminus of actively surging glaciers. (...) Overall, the southern side of Southeast2 Glacier experiences higher velocities (??75–100 m a–1 faster) than the northern side. This suggests that the surge has not affected the northern tributaries, as the higher velocities occur in the mid-section of the main feeder glacier, which happens to be at the southern edge of the system as a whole. (...) The spatial pattern of flow changes for Southeast2 Glacier is consistent with continued down-glacier propagation of a surge front. The existence of a surge-type glacier (Cunningham West) on southeast Devon Ice Cap has previously been inferred from the occurrence of looped surface moraines (Copland and others, 2003b), but has not previously been measured in its active phase there.""

Tulsequah Lake formed in the late 19th or early 20th century when a tributary glacier separated from the trunk of the Tulsequah Glacier. By the 1920s, Tulsequah Lake grew substantially due to the further recession of the tributary glacier(s); and some of the largest recorded outburst floods occurred during this period. A flood from Tulsequah Lake in 1958 released 229 million m3 of water with a peak discharge of 1,556 m3/s.",,,"Clague, J. J., Mathews, W. H. (1973): The Magnitude of Jökulhaups.

In 1991 the snout retreated out of the water onto terrain above lake level. Continued recession since then has produced an outwash fan-delta which is now advancing into the lake basin at a rate of several meters per year. In late August of 1991, several days of heavy rainfall caused erosion and flood damage in the Whistler-Garibaldi region. Discharge from Wedgemount Lake and Glacier into Wedgemount Creek was not measured but likely reached record values to cause destruction of the access trail and bridge crossing several kilometers downstream at a Late Pleistocene terminal moraine, where erosive flooding had not occurred in several hundred years. Unstable steep escarpments required relocation of the trail and construction of a new bridge several hundred meters upstream of the old crossing.",,,"WGMS (1998a): FoG 1990-1995 (Vol. VII),  IAHS (ICSI) / UNEP / UNESCO, WGMS, Zurich, Switzerland: 296 pp.",,1995

Insgesamt sollen zwischen 1589 und 1829 nicht weniger als 30 Seeausbrüche vorgekommen sein (Tufnell 1980). 1833/1834 stand ein drohender Seeausbruch bevor (nach Lütschg 19 Mio m3 Wasser gestaut). 1812-1817 fand ein grosser Vorstoss des Allalingletschers statt nach einem Rückgang im warmen Sommer 1811. 1822-1823 erreichte der Gletscher einen Maximalstand, in den Jahren 1825-1829 dauerte der Hochstand noch an (Lütschg 1926, S. 393-397). 1839 wird nach einem starken Anwachsen des Gletschers erneut von einem Seeausbruch gesprochen, bereits 1841 soll der See aber praktisch inexistent gewesen sein (Lütschg 1926, p. 401f). 1844 wurde nach einem erneut starken Vordringen des Allalingletschers mit zunehmender Gefahr eines Seeausbruchs propagiert, den Kanal tiefer und gleichzeitig an einen anderen Ort zu verlegen. Im selben Jahr sind auch die Gemeinde Präsidenten von Saas Almagell, Saas Fee, Saas Balen und Saas Grund an den Staatsrat des Kantons Wallis gelangt und verlangten dringend eine Inspektion und weitere Hilfe vor dem drohenden Ausbruch des Mattmarksees (zuweilen auch Distelsee genannt) (Lütschg 1926, p.403f.). Nach einem Anwachsen des Sees im Jahre 1852 wird die Länge desselben mit 2.4 km angegeben (Lütschg 1926, p. 410). Einem Bericht Prof. Culmanns an den Bundesrat von 1864 folgend (in: Lütschg 1926, p. 412), war es in dieser Zeit weniger das Gletschereis als die Moräne, die das Wasser staute. Der Abflusskanal war durch eine Eisbrücke überwölbt. Culmann vermutete, dass in kalten Jahren bei einem starken Vorrücken des Gletschers die Wärme des Wassers nicht mehr genügt, um das Eistor abzuschmelzen, die Wassermassen sich aufstauen und das Eis schliesslich dem Wasserdruck nicht mehr standhalten konnte. 1866 bedrohten die Wassermassen des Mattmarksees wiederum das Saastal, Kantonsingenieur Venetz konnte sie Gefahr aber mit dem Anlegen einer Galerie bannen (Forel 1888, p. 357). Das Hochwasser vom 17. August 1868 wurde scheinbar teilweise mitverursacht durch den gestauten Mattmarksee (Lütschg 1926, p. 413). 1879 war der See immer noch gestaut, die Wassermassen unter dem Gletscher abfliessend (Forel 1885, p. 374).. 1808 waren die Schäden nicht dermassen verheerend wie etwa 1680 oder 1772. Die Regierung des Kantons Wallis gewährt 1833 im Rahmen des drohenden Seeausbruchs,eine Subvention von Fr. 200.- für die Erstellung einer Ablaufrinne durch den Gletscher. Der Seespiegel steht im August 1834 rund 29.5m über dem Nullpunkt beim Pegel von Mattmark. Gemäss Ruppen 1851, p. 107 hatte sich der Allalingletscher etwas zurückgezogen und der Seespiegel wurde durch einen 6 Meter tiefen Kanal abgesenkt. Durch die Gallerie unterhalb durchs Eis, die der Kantonsingenieur Venetz im späten 1834 durch den Damm gesprengt hatte, floss das Wasser auch 1836 noch ab und senkte den See bedeutend (Lütschg 1926, p. 399). In späteren Jahren, so etwa 1849, musste der Abflusskanal ausgräumt werden, weil er immer wieder durch Stein- (oder Eis-)schlag aufgefüllt wurde.",,,"Lütschg 1926, p. 393-398, 401-404, Forel 1885 & 1888, Ruppen 1851, Tufnell 1980","http://www.glacierhazards.ch",

Der Seeausbruch stand in Zusammenhang mit Starkniederschlägen, die den See schliesslich zum Überlaufen brachten (Bruch des Steges). Durch den stark erhöhten subglazialen Abfluss wurde das Gletschertor des Allalingletschers bedeutend erweitert. In den 54 Stunden des Hochwassers (22. -25.9.) floss mehr als ein Viertel der durchschnittlichen jährlichen Abflussmenge des Mattmarkgebietes ab (pro Jahr 61.5 Mio m3 in der Periode 1914-1918). Lütschg (1926, p. 292) nennt die maximale Abflussmenge von 140 m3/s eine Ungeheurlichkeit sondergleichen. Die Wassermassen rissen in Saas Almagell und Saas Grund alles, was ihnen im Weg stand, mit und überschwemmten den Talboden (Imseng 1979, p. 143). In den Jahren 1925/26 wurde die Vispe am nördlichen Ende des Mattmarksees in einen Felstunnel verlegt, um die Gefahr der wiederholten Seeausbrüche zu eliminieren. Der Tunnel wies eine Länge von 500m und Kosten von Fr. 400’000.- auf (Imseng 1979, p. 143). Bereits 1905 beschlossen die Gemeinden Saas Balen, Almagell, Grund und Fee, einen Stollen in den Fels zu bauen.

During a field campaign in 1993, glacier-bed topography/ice thickness was determined by low-frequency radio echo soundings along several profiles across the glacier surface. Thermistors were installed in a number of boreholes drilled to the bed with hot water. Finally, surface velocites were measured by repeatedly surveying the locations of 15 stakes. The results from the field measurements formed the basis for model calculations using the finite element method to determine the flowlines of the glacier as well as the englacial temperature and stress fields. In addition, permafrost conditions underneath the hanging glacier and the possible effects of atmospheric warming on the stability of the investigated hanging glacier were considered in order to develop a monitoring concept. Within the framework of this concept, the evolution at the site is observed with an automatic camera and aerial photographs.

The results primarily show a rapid decrease in ice thickness and flow velocity since the early 1980s, especially near ice-marginal Lake No. 3 where the fast-thinning ice dam approached floating conditions. Seismic refraction, D.C. resistivity and gravimetry soundings were performed together with hydrological tracer experiments to determine the structure and stability of the moraine dam at proglacial Lake No. 1. The soundings indicate a maximum moraine thickness of more than 100 metres and no water saturation; erosion-sensitive extremely high porosity and even ground caverns near the surface likely resulted from degradation of sub- and periglacial permafrost following 19th/20th-century retreat of the partially cold glacier tongue. The safety and retention capacity of proglacial Lake No. 1 were enhanced by deepening and reinforcing (concrete injections) the outlet structure on top of the moraine complex. The water level of ice-dammed Lake No. 3 was lowered by excavating an ice-marginal channel and filling the excavated material into the lake. Thermokarst Lake No. 5 was artficially drained by cutting through debris-covered dead ice resting on permafrost. As a consequence of these measures, the situation now appears to be safe for the years to come.

Die Murganganrisszone befand sich auf 2450 m Höhe in einem steilen Felscouloir mit Lockersedimentbedeckung. Diese Fläche war 50 Jahre vor dem Ereignis noch gletscherbedeckt, während des neuzeitlichen Gletscherhochstandes um 1850 erreichte der Gletscher die Kote von ungefähr 2040 m, wo noch charakteristische Stirnmoränen zu finden sind. Das Einzugsgebiet weist ein Gefälle von 58 % auf mit einer Fläche von 390 ha, der maximale Erosionsquerschnitt im Anrissgebiet beläuft sich auf 80 m2, die maximale Tiefenerosion 5 m, wobei es sich um progressive Erosion handelte. Der Murgang selbst ereignete sich lange vor der nachfolgenden Hochwasserspitze und wurde möglicherweise durch eine Verlagerung des Abflusses aus dem Gletscher oberhalb des Couloirs ausgelöst. Durch das grosse Startvolumen von 20'000 m3 konnte der Murgang über ein relativ flaches Zwischenstück von minimal 14 % Gefälle bis ins Dorf Münster gelangen. Insgesamt wurden 66'000 m3 Geschiebematerial erodiert und 20'000 m3 wieder akkumuliert. Im Dorf Münster wurden etwa 25'000 bis 30'000 m3 Material abgelagert, wobei noch zusätzlich etwa 10'000 bis 20'000 m3 fluviales Geschiebe durch das nachfolgende Hochwasser dazukam. Das Pauschalgefälle betrug 21%, die Transitstrecken wiesen eine grosse Levéebildung auf. Die Schäden im Dorf Münster entstanden vor allem als Folge der Verfüllung des Gerinnes (Verstopfung bei der Brücke der Furka-Oberalp-Bahn) durch den Murgang und der fluvialen Geschiebeablagerung durch das nachfolgende Hochwasser. Die grössten Murgangschäden entstanden wahrscheinlich durch die Überschotterung im Dorf (übermurte Fläche ca. 30’000m2), wobei viel Geschiebe und Schlamm inden Kellern abgelagert wurde. Brücken und Häuser entlang des Gerinnes wurden beschädigt. Der Fussgängersteg und gestapeltes Holz wurden mitgerissen. Es sind weitere historische Murgänge aus dem gleichen Gebiet bekannt, die allerdings normalerweise aufgrund des geringen Pauschalgefälles (mit 21 % eines der geringsten der 1987er Ereignisse) nicht bis ins Dorf reichten. Beim vorliegenden Fall wurde dies durch das grosse Startvolumen ermöglicht.

Themethods applied include photogrammetry, terrestrial laser scanning, structural geological analysis, examination of meteorologicaldata, carbon-14 (14C) dating of organic material in permafrost ice from a tension crack and numerical modelling of likely modesof failure. Despite a complete lack of in situ measurements in the rock wall prior to the event and of direct observations duringthe event, the available data allow the determination of the approximate timing of the event as well as the structural predisposition,the probable mode of failure and the timescale of several millennia involved in the triggering of the failure of the rock pillar.

Das Anrissgebiet befindet sich in einer subrezenten Endmoräne des Gletschers in einem tiefen Felscouloir (Anrisshöhe 2360 m, möglicher Permafrost, Fläche oberhalb des Anrisses 0.5 ha), die 1850er Gletscherbedeckung reichte bis auf 2300 m. Die Hangneigung des Anrissgebiets wird auf 67 % (34°) beziffert, mit markanter Hangversteilung unterhalb des Anrisses. Es besteht kein oberflächlicher Wasserzufluss, jedoch wahrscheinlich ein erhöhter Grundwasserspiegel, vom unmittelbar oberhalb gelegenen See her gespiesen. Die oberste Schicht, deren Untergrenze unterhalb des maximalen Seespiegels zu liegen scheint, ist sehr locker gelagert und 5-8 m mächtig. Diese oberste durchlässige Schicht besitzt eine grosse Abflusskapazität, sodass der Seespiegel auch bei starken Niederschlägen wahrscheinlich nur schwach ansteigt. Der Murgangabruch war ev. bedingt durch den erhöhten Wasserspiegel im Lockermaterial, wodurch das Material lokal gesättigt wurde. Im Couloir ist ein noch grosses Schuttpotential vorhanden (ca. 120'000 m3 ), ein Seeausbruch ins Couloir wäre möglich. Das gesamte Erosionsvolumen betrug 7'500 m3 (5'000 m3 im Anrissgebiet), das Akkumulationsvolumen ca. 10'000 m3.

"CH","TRIFT VS",3386,5435,20149999,0,0,0,0,0,1,"A large sector of the glacierized northwest face of Weissmies mountain in the Saas valley recently became unstable. This new development likely stems from a climate-induced glacier thinning of the supporting Triftgletscher and the steady progression from freezing to melting conditions at the ice/bed interface. Consequently, in the summer of 2014 a section of the glacierized face with 800'000 m3 of ice reverted to an 'active phase' with high surface flow velocities, thereby increasing the likelihood of a major icefall. In such an event, an ice/snow avalanche could threaten the population and infrastructure of the Saas valley. A monitoring campaign was initiated to detect warning signals of dangerous break-off events in order to enable timely evacuation of endangered areas. Interferometric and Doppler radar, seismic and acoustic sensors, optical imaging and GPS receivers were installed to provide real-time continuous surface displacement and ice fracture development data. A critical increase in surface velocities is a clear sign of an impending icefall. Thus it is possible to predict rupture time based on surface velocity data. Up to now, only minor icefalls have been observed (Preiswerk et al., 2016).",,,"Glaciological Report No. 135/136","http://www.glamos.ch",

Hinter der toteisführenden orographische linken Seitenmoräne des Tschiervagletschers, die teilweise das Tal des Roseggletschers abdämmte, bildete sich ein See. An der Basis des die Umgebung überhöhenden Moränenmaterials öffnete sich das Tor des Roseggletscherbaches. Es wurde befürchtet, dass durch erhöhte Wasserakkumulation und gleichzeitige Schwächung der Abdämmung ein katastrophaler Wasserausbruch die Folge sein könnte. Deshalb wurde bereits 1947 ein sorgfältige Überwachung empfohlen. Im Verlauf des grossen Oberengadiner Hochwassers vom 21./22. August 1954 wurde infolge Schneeschmelze und starker Regenfälle der Seespiegel um 0.85m angehoben. Durch das Einschneiden des Baches in die abdämmende Tschiervamoräne unter starker Erosion kam es zu einem raschen Abfliessen der aufgestauten Wassermassen. Dabei wurden etwa 30'000 m3 Material talwärts geführt mit insgesamt 100 - 120'000 m3 Wasserabfluss. Im Moränendamm wurde viel Toteis, unter dem Sander viel gefrorenes Seeis freigelegt. Durch die starke Erosion im Bachlauf wurde die Uferböschung (Schutthalde bei Muot da Crasta) destabilisiert, das Bachbett zwischen Muot da Crasta und Alp Prüna erhöht. In Zukunft wurde ein langsames Auslaufen des Sees mit erhöhter Geschiebeführung im Rosegbach angenommen. Am Muot da Crasta wurden grössere Rutschungen erwartet. Die ausgeflossenen Wasser- und Schuttmassen förderten gröberes Gerölle bis zur Alp Misau, das Feinmaterial (40-50%) bis in die Oberengadiner Talebene. Starke Schäden gab es im Rosegtal, wo Brücken fortgerissen, Weiden mit Geschiebe überführt, der Fahrweg und die Wasserleitung teilweise zerstört wurden und weiterer Schaden am Wals auftrat. Als Sanierungsmassnahmen wurden ein Retentionsbecken, Geschieberückhaltesperren und Hangstabilisierung vorgeschlagen.",,,"Variations 1946, p. 8, Variations 1947, Töndury 1954, p. 312ff., Haeberli 1980, p. 61f.","http://www.glacierhazards.ch",

Finally, about 2 x 1 million m3 of rock detached, deposited on the glacier tongue, and collapsed in August 2008.

The tunnel is 2 km long and cost about 15 million Swiss Francs. For this glacier, at least five historical glacier outburst floods are known from written sources since about 1600 (Raymond et al. 2003). The last of these events happened on 2 July 1951. According to the local newspaper, the event happened at 4:30 a.m. and caused a five-meterhigh flood wave in the gorge of Lütschine. The water, ice and debris flood destroyed two bridges and flooded the region around the train station of Grindelwald Grund.",,,"Oppikofer, Jaboyedoff, and Keusen. Nature Geoscience 1 (2008): 531–535.

"CH","UNTERER GRINDELWALD",3402,443,20099999,0,0,0,0,0,1,"To avert future destructive floods, the lake level should be kept as low as possible to keep potential overall lake water volume within a safe limit. To achieve this goal, in 2009 the Bernese authorities constructed a 2.1 km long drainage tunnel on the right side of the gorge from Marmorbruch to the lake. The tunnel exits onto the glacier surface behind the debris-covered ice dam at the lowest possible level, so that the water from the lake can drain through the tunnel. It is planned to adjust the tunnel exit level to the lowering glacier surface as required. After 2009, the glacier surface in the vicinity of the ice dam experienced a substantial thinning because huge amounts of debris were removed during tunnel construction in order to keep the tunnel entrance safe and the lake level low. As a consequence, the glacier surface was largely debris-free in the vicinity of the ice dam, giving rise to high melt rates and subsequent surface lowering. Presently the glacier surface is 10-20 m below the tunnel entrance. The location of the glacier lake has moved some 500m upstream, close to the confluence of Ischmeer and Unders Ischmeer. The lake is no longer supraglacial, it is proglacial. This means that rapid drainage through the ice is no longer possible with the present configuration.",,,"Glaciological Report No. 135/136","http://www.glamos.ch",

Some contorted longitudinal foliations on the lower glacier snout (near the diverging point of CYG) can be distinguished from a finequality Landsat ETM+ image from 14 September 2004 (Fig. 2b), implying that at least one of its branches has surged in past decades. Furthermore, two types of evidence during the surge directly prove that CYG is a surge-type glacier. The first is that its termini advanced during 2008–10. As mentioned in Section 2, the united Yulinchuan glacier disintegrated between 1972 and 2004 (Fig. 2a and b). However, Landsat images acquired after 2007 (Fig. 2d–f) show that the termini of CYG have clearly advanced and reconverged into NYG and WYG, indicating that CYG has surged. The second piece of evidence from the surge stage is from surface crevasse development. Similar to the CYG termini, the glacier surface has experienced dramatic changes, as clearly demonstrated by the Landsat image sequence (Fig. 2d–h). The surface was dominated by continuous and smooth ice before 2008, with some longitudinal features (see Fig. 2b and c). However, some transverse crevasses appeared just below the CYG equilibrium line on 11 October 2008, similar to those found on some Svalbard surging glaciers (Sund and others, 2009). The surface crevasses then entered a stage of rapid development, and their area expanded quickly between 11 October and 14 December 2008. After that, crevasses developed more slowly, especially after 4 March 2009. The surface became stable after 7 September 2010 (Fig. 2f).""

This indicates that the surge/collapse mechanism might have been different, that lubrification by melt water might have played a role, or that the glacier has reached a different point of dynamic stability. It is well possible that after three years, the collapsed material was more a loose ice/rock mélange rather than a homogenous glacier. A small part of the flat, lower glacier remained in its bed.

A surge-type fl ow acceleration started in 2001 and continued a few years with a maximum ice fl ow speed increase of an entire order of magnitude compared to normal conditions. At the terminal area Belvedere Glacier experienced a strong uplift of the ice causing several hazard and tourist facility problems. In the upper glacier area, at the foot of the Monte Rosa east face, the surge-type development and related changes in the hydraulic system resulted in the formation of a smaller supraglacial lake in 2001, that reformed in 2002 and signifi cantly increased in size with up to 1 x 1 million m3 of water. The rapid lake increase and associated serious hazards for the downstream community of Macugnaga prompted a major emergency action by the Italian civil protection authorities, including pumping and detailed monitoring of the lake. In 2003, the lake formed once more and grew to approximately the same size as in 2002. On 18 June, 2003, a subglacial outburst of the supraglacial lake occurred.

The powderpart of the avalanche including ice and debris fragments, however, overtopped the lateral moraine of the Belvedere glacier and covered the plain around the Zamboni alpine hut.

The corresponding ratios of vertical drop height to horizontal travel distance (H/L) were about 0.58 for the solid part and 0.52 for the powder part of the avalanche.

Frequent small-scale as well as several large-scale rock and ice avalanches and debris flow events have led to significant topographic change. A major rock/ice avalanche was reported in summer 1990 and several rock and ice avalanche events followed, detaching large parts of a hanging glacier and underlying bedrock. In August 2005, an ice avalanche with a volume of about 1.1 x 1 million m3 occurred (also reported in the WGMS, 2008), and in April 2007 a rock avalanche of 0.2 x 1 million m3 detached from the uppermost part of the face where continuous permafrost is expected. The volume of the 2005 ice avalanche is among the largest documented in the European Alps over the past 100 years. Such slope failures can trigger far-reaching chain reactions, especially in combination with the temporary supraglacial lake ‘Effimero’ which developed in connection with a surge-type behaviour of the Belvedere Glacier in September 2001 and reached a maximum volume of 3 x 1 million m3 in the following two summers. Rock and ice avalanches from the Monte Rosa east face into the full lake could have triggered a catastrophic outburst with an extended range of destruction downstream. In view of the ongoing or even enhanced atmospheric warming, it is very likely that slope failures from bedrock and hanging glaciers on the Monte Rosa east face will continue to be a source of hazards for the populated down-valley region.",,,"Fischer, L, H Eisenbeiss, A Kääb, C Huggel, and W Haeberli (2011): Permafrost and Periglacial Processes, 22, 140–152.

The rock debris was deposited partly on the Brenva Glacier below and partly moved on the glacier surface by mobilising a significant volume of snow and ice. The estimated volume of rock in the avalanche was approximately 2 x 1 million m3, and nearly the same volume of snow and ice was mobilised along the path. The runout was approximately 5.5 km with a total fall of 2,300 m resulting in an overall slope of 18.8°. The rock avalanche was preceded by a deep roaring sound and took place as an airborne powder avalanche. The debris was spilled from the lateral moraine and piled up on the valley nearby, forming a natural dam as much as 25 m high, which temporarily blocked the flow of the Dora Baltea River. On the opposite valley side, hundreds of conifers were thrown down due to the air wave. Two skiers lost their lives. The rock-ice avalanche of January 18, 1997 is to be considered the most recent and catastrophic event of increasing rock-fall activity that has taken place along the “Sperone della Brenva” beginning in August 1996. A more detailed description of the event can be found in Barla and others (2000) as well as in Giani and others (2001). Avery similar phenomenon had already occurred in the same area between November 14 and 19, 1920, when two large rockslides triggered a rock-ice avalanche along the Brenva Glacier of 6–7 x 1 million m3, which dammed the valley and ascended the opposite slope.",,,"Barla G., Dutto F. & Mortara G.

In August 1986 a regenerated glacier covering approx. 400 m2 avalanched into the Krundalen Valley killing three people. The regenerated glacier was situated on a ledge with a slope of about 30°, and the avalanche involving a volume of some 100,000 m3 descended a vertical distance of 500–600 meters over a horizontal trajectory length of some 800 m giving an overall trajectory slope of some 35°. Observations from eye witnesses seem to indicate that the whole ice mass came down at once. In 1987, investigations including measurements of mass balance and vertical and horizontal velocities were initiated in order to calculate the change in surface altitude. The emergence velocity decreased from 3.6 m/year at the front to 1.3 m/year 300 m upglacier from the front, while the mass balance increased from -2 m/year to -1.3 m/year in the same region. This means that the ice surface is rising near the front resulting in an advance of the glacier. Ice blocks break off and accumulate on the ledge, and the ice volume in 1992 was about the same as in 1986. This means that the probability of another ice avalanche is increasing from year to year.",,,"WGMS (1998a): FoG 1990-1995 (Vol. VII),  IAHS (ICSI) / UNEP / UNESCO, WGMS, Zurich, Switzerland: 296 pp.",,1995

About 19:30 or 20:00, the water discharge suddenly increased, and there were also a lot of rocks and other sediment. The discharge decreased during the night of 6th August and throughout 7th, although discharge was still higher than normal on 8th August. Satellite images are inconclusive regarding the location of the glacier-dammed lake that drained and a possible source is a small lake at the margin of the glacier south of the peak Gangnesaksla.

On 14 December 1991, shortly after midnight, a 500 m wide by 700 m high rock buttress failed with no apparent trigger, taking with it the top 10 m of the summit of New Zealand’s highest peak, the High Peak of Mount Cook (3,764 m, 12,349 ft; now 3,754 m) in New Zealand’s Southern Alps. An estimated 14 x 1 million m3 of rock cascaded down the steep east face of the mountain, an initial fall of about 1,500 m. A small part of the avalanche then rose 150 m to overtop an adjacent ridge. The remainder deflected down the local slope to descend a 1,000 m high icefall and cross the Tasman Glacier. The total fall was 2,720 m. At the far side of the Tasman Glacier, the run-up was 70 m. When it came to rest, debris was spread to a distance of 7.5 km from its source (average slope = 20°) over an area of some 7 km2. The accompanying dust cloud darkened snow to a height of 700 m on the valley above the Tasman Glacier, and an air blast was felt 5 km up-glacier from the outer edge of the debris. Witnesses 3.5 km from the source reported bright orange flashes from rock impacts high on the mountainside. Seismographs, which recorded a clear seismic signal from the avalanche, indicated that it started about 13 December at 11.11 hrs (universal time), reaching a crescendo equivalent to a magnitude 3.9 earthquake within 20 seconds. Maximum energy was emitted for about 70 seconds. If this were the duration of its passage from the summit to across the Tasman Glacier, the avalanche had an average speed of 300 km/hr. A very low amplitude seismic signal continued for at least 5 hours. The witnesses indicated that large rockfalls from the summit area continued for this duration; indeed, “minor” rockfalls from the summit area continued for this duration, and still were occurring two days later when we visited the site. The course of the Murchison River (flowing, from Murchison Glacier 711J/011) has followed a course distal of the left lateral moraine of the Tasman Glacier. During a storm of January 1994, the river breached the moraine and now permanently enters the proglacial lake of the Tasman glacier.

The initial volume is estimated between 0.2 x 1 million m3 and 0.4 x 1 million m3, which probably increased along the flow path. The avalanche travelled over the steep surface of Glacier 513 into Lake 513 at 4,400 m a.s.l.. The lake was impacted by the avalanche along its longitudinal axes.  Despite the 20 m freeboard at the bedrock dam in April 2010, the impact of the avalanche caused an overtopping. The overflowing volume of water may have been on the order of 1 x 1 million m3. Strong erosion started below the lake, but most sediments were deposited in the upper part oft he plane of Pampa de Shonquil at about 3,650 m a.s.l.. The flood travelled further, and in the once again steeper part of the Rio Chucchun catchment a debris flow formed again, travelling down to the provincial capital of Carhuaz.

Such ana event could have triggered a surge of the kit-ke-jerav glacier.(...) The Kit-ke-jerav and Yishkuk glaciers show striking signs of a younger glacial advance or thickening at their lateral ice-marginal portions. Looped moraine bulges are characteristic landforms of lateral ice advances. (...) In their middle and lower sections, the Yishkuk and Kit-ke-jerav Glaciers are bordered by younger lateral moraines. The older lateral moraine has been completely overridden and destroyed by recent glacier activities or transformed by supraglacial dumping processes at many locations, which indicates a current glacier advance or thickening (Iturrizaga, 2007).""

Recent intensifi cation of rockslide processes was caused by the progressive deglaciation on the crestal revetment of the fi rn basin due to strongly unfavourable glacier mass balance conditions of the 1999–2001 period. Being devoid of an icy weathering-protective layer, the steep slopes of the axial ridge zone began to be eroded too rapidly, continuing even during the winter months. The deposits from the event of 1st of July, 2003 covered parts of the glacier accumulation area within the 3200–3600 m a.s.l.

The volume of the collapsed matter, distributed over an area of about 0.10 km2, or 4% of the glacier surface, is estimated at about 70000 m3. The consequent reduction of heat infl ux to the snow/fi rn/ice surface distorted the spatial pattern considerably and diminished ablation values greatly.

"RU","KOLKA",1193,8493,20029999,1,0,1,1,0,0,"A tremendous glacier hazard of a complex nature arose in the Genaldon Valley, North Ossetia Republic in the Caucasus, Russia, on 20 September, 2002. The catastrophe was unexpected, as it occurred only 30 years after the previous glacier surge. Changed external conditions must have accelerated the process. KVM2004: The instability of Kolka glacier was also suggested to be linked to its previous surge activity (Kotlyakov et al. 2004). An ice/rock avalanche (or a series of ice avalanches) from the glaciers on the northern slope of the Kazbek volcano (Main Caucasus Ridge) hanging over the Kolka Glacier, provoked a strong mechanical impact upon the valley part of the glacier, most of which was pushed away from its original location. A mixture of ice, water and entrapped rocks tumbled about 18-20 km downvalley at a velocity of up to 180-200 km/hr until it collided with the narrow entrance of the Karmadon gorge at the village Karmadon. A huge body of ice/debris conglomerate of 115±10 x 1 million m3 piled up there. A mud and debris flow was ejected from these deposits and travelled further on for another 15-17 km downvalley and stopped only 4 km short of the town of Gizel. Depending on the exact definition of the initiation and farthest travel point (initial ice/rock slide, Kolka glacier and ice dam or farthest point of debris flow) the ratio of vertical drop height (H) to horizontal travel distance (L) is 0.08–0.15. The body dammed the right-hand tributary of the Genaldon River, and a number of glacier-dammed lakes were formed. The largest, Saniba Lake, inundated the nearby village and attained a volume of 4.9 x 1 million m3 by October 2002, with the maximum depth exceeding 21 m. The catastrophe claimed at least 125 lives. In spite of the fact that similar hazards have been registered here in the past (1834, 1902, 1970 A.D.), the 2002 event was extraordinary by the scale of the disaster. The mechanism of hazard origination, extreme initial acceleration, high flow velocity, long travel distance and a huge mass of transported material (130–140 x 1 million m3 in total, including 110 x 1 million m3 of ice and debris) is still enigmatic and several points of view, some of them mutually contradictory, were published. The principal triggering impulse was explained by at least three groups of possible reasons: meteorological (abundant precipitation and excessive snow/ice masses on the slope), seismic (geological faults, slight earthquake on the eve of the hazard) and volcanic (activation of sub-glacier fumarole activity of Mt. Kazbek, adjacent extinct volcano). The hypothesis of premature glacier surge (after the previous surge of the Kolka Glacier in 1969) was also suggested. Ongoing monitoring of land regeneration and present evolution of the ice/debris conglomerate body in the Karmadon Depression reveals a rather rapid icemelt rate at present, though the ice body could take about 10 years or so to vanish completely.",,,"Popovnin (MGU), Huggel (GIUZ).

A part of its front began to crawl over the northern half of the fumarole field in the volcanic crater, damming the source of the Vulkannaya River. By May 1997 the glacier tongue buried the river channel completely, thus promoting formation of the dammed lake. After the snowmelt process became intensive, the river cut a tunnel in the ice dam and partly drained the lake, lowering its water level considerably, so that in summer 1997 the lake area did not exceed 5,000 m2 and it was not deeper than 2–3 m. During 1998 the glacier continued moving further westwards. It almost set against the northwestern flank of the NE volcanic crater, overlapping most of fumarole and hydrothermal springs in the northern part of the NE crater. The glacier snout thickness at the surging front came to approximately 10 m in autumn 1998, its relative elevation above the channel of the Vulkannaya River varying from 30 to 50 m. The total area of the advanced part of the glacier was estimated as 30,000 m2, while its volume was not less than 1 million m3. Possible interaction between changes of hydrogeological conditions in the active craters of the Mutnovskiy Volcano and its eruption is supposed. This interaction can become apparent in the dynamics and mass exchange of glaciers. Such alterations of external conditions may serve as a trigger of phreatic and phreato-magmatic eruptions of the Mutnovskiy Volcano at the present stage of its evolution.",,,"Ya.D.Muravyov (IVRAN).

From 1995 to 1998 the glacier advanced about 2.8 km. "" SMWeb2012 ""The surge occurred in a climate of decreasing overall ice volume, so we need to revise the notion that surging is triggered by a return to an original geometry, and we suggest Fridtjovbreen’s surge was triggered by increasing shear stresses primarily caused by increases in surface slope. The dynamics of the 1990s surge was studied using satellite radar interferometry (Murray et al., 2003a). The glacier underwent a slow acceleration between 1991 and June 1995, with flow rates exceeding the balance velocity throughout. Fast flow started in the lower third of the glacier (Murray et al., 2003a). The trunk and NW tributaries moved faster than the NE tributary. The glacier surface changed, with intermittent lakes and increased transverse crevassing (Musial, 1994). The glacier front remained static until at least March 1994; however, by October 1995 the glacier had advanced 350 m. Between June 1995 and February 1996, the glacier accelerated rapidly, reaching a measured maximum ice flow speed of 2.5 m d 1. By May 1997, the glacier front had advanced  2.8 km from its pre-surge location at peak rates of 4.2 m d 1 and its margin became intensely chaotically crevassed. The next measurement in October 1997 showed flow rates had begun to decrease and the margin had begun to retreat (Murray et al., 2003a), however, Lønne (2006) reports subsequent re-advance of 650 m with maximum frontal extent in 1998/1999. The maximum frontal position was less advanced than that of 1860–1861 (Fig. 1). Bamber et al. (2005) reported thinning of  0.26 m a 1 along a single flowline on Fridtjovbreen between 1996 and 2002, but these measurements were made after the main advance had occurred and are not comparable either in technique or timeframe with the measurements we present in this paper. (...) Field observations suggested that the fast-flow phase of the 1990s surge started near the terminus (A. J. Hodson, personal communication, 2002) and propagated up-glacier, initially to the NW tributary in agreement with flow speeds.""

LA2002 Listed by BM2009 ""Based on satellite imagery and field reports from J.O. Hagen, the margin of Monacobreen retreated 0.75-1.45km between 1966 and 1990 and then began to surge in the early 1990s (Luckman and others, 2002). Peak flow during the active surge phase is thought to have occurred in JAnuary 1994, shown by the twofold increase in velocities from 1992 (Luckmand and others, 2002). Radio-echo sounding (RES) was utilized by Bamber (1987) in the late 1980s to infer the glacier thermal regime. The RES showed an internal reflecting horizon (IRH) at about 120-200m depth. The IRH obscures any bed returns and suggests the glacier was warm based over its accumulation area, thus providing further evidence of the glacier building to a surge initiation in the late 1980s, to early 1990s. (...) Surface flow rates increased to about 4.5 +- 0.6md from 0/6md during quiescence. The timing of changes in flow speed provide further evidence that the Monacobreen surfe peaked between 1993 and 1995, which is in agreement with Strozzi and others (2002) which concluded that the surge maximum was in 1994. The terminus advanced almost 2km during the surge from its 1991 position, and the glacier continued to advance after velocities peaked. Returned to quiescence at the end of 1997.""

Surge onset occured about 135km from the ice divide (Roush, 2003). Maximum flow velocities were about 10-20md (Roush, 2003) near the terminus and up to 5md in the lower Bagley ice valley (Fatland and Lingle 2002). No velocity data were able to confirm the existence of an organized surge front propagating upstream or downstream. A leading surface undulation propagated downstream at about 100md (Roush, 2003). Upstream propagation was less clear. Fatland and Lindle (1998) found a delay between surge onset on the Lower Bering (about 130km) and a subsequent acceleration of the West Bagley (WB) which lies about 60km upstream. Assuming that the delay was due to an upstream propagation front originating from the surge onset locatio, Fatland and Lingle (1998) estimated the upstream propagation velocity was 200-500md.

The increase in driving stress causes slight acceleration in the accumulation zone, and consequent thickening where the accelerated front approaches stagnant ice downstream. (...) It is interesting that while the thickening moved downstream significantly in 2009, the majority of the drawdown did not move upstream at all. (...)

The shaking triggered several rock and ice avalanches on the Black Rapids Glacier. The main rockfall originated from the south walls of the glacier, crossed a medial moraine (~30 m high), and continued across the entire glacier valley (> 2 km). The rock blanket covers an estimated 13 km2 of the glacier’s ablation area. A very crude estimate suggests that the total volume exceeds 10 x 1 million m3.",,,"USGS.

At this time the surge was well underway, with much of the upper reservoir region showing significant (up to 70 m) drawdown. The surface was highly crevassed, with surge-related crevassing extending to the pass with Canwell Glacier to the west (about 1890 m MSL), to the pass with the Chistochina Glacier (177) to the east, and high into each of the accumulation basins on the north side of the glacier (up to 2165 m). No accumulation basins were unaffected, but those to the west and northwest showed the largest drawdown. The lower part of the glacier was extremely broken, with serac fields typical of full surge conditions. On 26 July 1994 the surge front was mapped using GPS in an aircraft (± 60 m). This front was at an elevation of about 1220 m and extended into the terminal (surge) moraine region. The surge front appeared to be an active bulge up to ca. 50 m in height which was progressing into the relatively stagnant ice of the terminal lobe. On 7 September 1994 the glacier was observed again, and the surge front remapped. Very little advance was seen since 26 July, indicating that the surge probably ended in early August. When the surge ended the front was about 4.4 km upvalley of the end of the terminal moraine, and thus was this distance short of the maximum extent of some previous surge.

"US","LECONTE",85,206,19949999,0,1,0,0,0,0,"LeConte Glacier is a grounded, temperate tidewater glacier located approximately 35 km east of Petersburg, in southeast Alaska. The glacier is approximately 35 km long, covers an area of 469 km2, and has an accumulation area ratio of nearly 90% (Post and Motyka, 1995). It underwent a 2 km calving retreat between 1994 and 1998 after a 32-year period of stability. Large icebergs generated during the retreat were discharged into Fredrick Sound where they posed a threat to navigation and caused damage to docks and piers in Petersburg harbors (Motyka and others 1998). Dramatic thinning accompanied the retreat, both at the terminus and along the length of the glacier. The thinning rate, averaged over the entire glacier was 2.4 m a-1 (measured by airborne altimetry from 1996 to 2000; Arendt and others, 2002), while near the terminus the glacier thinned at a rate of 25 to 35 m a-1 over the same period. The terminus position stabilised at a fjord narrows by 1999 but the glacier continues to calve large volumes of icebergs into the bay throughout the year. The near-terminus surface topography is steep, with surface slopes ranging from 8° to 12°. Heavy crevassing dominates the surface of the lower 8 km of the glacier, with the lowermost 4 km consisting of a chaotic pattern of unstable seracs. Surface velocities near the terminus measured 27 m d-1 in 1999 (O’Neel and others 2001). Just below the equilibrium line (ELAÅ920 m a.s.l.) and about 7 km upstream of the present terminus, surface velocities are still relatively high (3.5 m d-1). The lower region of the glacier experiences extreme longitudinal strain rates (at some locations they exceed 5 a-1); these are responsible for the heavy and chaotic crevassing. The terminal ice cliff has an average height of 50 to 60 m above the fjord surface. The centerline water depth at the terminus in 1999 was 270 m placing the terminus close to floatation. A nearly floating terminus in deep-water appears to be critical for rapid calving and high ice velocities (Motyka 1997, O’Neel and others 2003). The data at LeConte show no correlation between ice velocity and the occurrence of calving events. This observation holds over seasonal time scales as well as over a single calving event; we also observed no changes in ice flow as a result of massive calving. Submarine melting also contributes substantially to ice loss at the terminus of LeConte Glacier and can be at least as significant, if not more, as calving over seasonal time scales (Motyka and others 2003). Melt rates are related to fjord water temperatures and to forced convection driven by buoyant freshwater subglacial discharge. These melt rates are therefore likely to be highest in late summer and after periods of heavy rainfall. At LeConte Glacier the proglacial fjord temperature at 40 m depth was found to increase from 3° C in early June to 7° C in early September 2001. ",,,"R.J. Motyka, AUS.

The avalanche was almost entirely composed of glacier ice and snow, having very low debris content. The event was one in a series of very large ice avalanches on Red Glacier which seem to occur every 3 to 4 years. Confirmed previous events of comparable size or even larger and with higher rock/debris contents, took place in the years 1960, 1978, 1980, 1994, 1997, 2000 and 2003.

The last surge of this glacier was a two-pulse surge in 1982 and 1983, with the second year’s pulse being the strongest and propagating downglacier into the moraines from previous surges. The 1995 surge caused extensive crevassing high up into the upper reaches of the glacier, but the drawdown in the regions was not as large as it was in 1982–83. Crevassing in the middle reaches of the glacier was not as chaotic or severe as it was in 1983. Early June 1995 was a record warm period in the nearby village of Yakutat, and on 11 June there was a large flood of turbid water in the terminal stream of Variegated Glacier. Time lapse camera data shows no significant surge motion for some time after this date, indicating that the surge pulse terminated in June. However, comparison of airborne elevation profiles made on 5 June 1995 and 5 June 1996 show some continued drawdown in the upper reaches of the glacier and a progression of the bulge at the surge front downglacier a short distance. This indicates that there may have been a small second pulse of the surge sometime between summer 1995 and spring 1996.
